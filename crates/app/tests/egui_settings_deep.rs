//! Headless **interaction** tests for the two C0PL4ND settings sections the
//! existing `egui_settings` suite never visits: **Motion** (the largest single
//! block of `settings.rs` — the master animation switch, the CRT/mesh/VHS
//! effect gating, and the chromatic-aberration first-enable seed) and
//! **Privacy** (history capture, incognito, clear-now), driven by
//! `egui_kittest`.
//!
//! ## Discipline (non-negotiable)
//!
//! Every test drives the **real** production frame loop
//! ([`C0pl4ndApp::frame_tick`] → `settings::show`) and operates the **real**
//! widgets by their accessible label, then asserts an **observable** outcome the
//! interaction actually caused. There is NO set-state-then-assert-the-same-state
//! tautology and NO test-only mirror of the settings UI.
//!
//! Two observation channels are used, both reading state DERIVED from the live
//! config each frame (never a test mirror):
//!
//! 1. **The accessibility tree** — a widget's `numeric_value` / `is_disabled` is
//!    rebuilt from `config.effects.*` on every frame, so asserting on it observes
//!    the live config. This is the only channel available for the Motion section:
//!    the `config_*` accessors live in `app_config.rs`, and no accessor exists for
//!    `config.effects.*`. It is the same channel the existing suite's
//!    `mode_off_disables_the_channel_combo` / `picking_an_update_channel_changes_
//!    the_combo_value` tests use.
//! 2. **The host's public accessors** (`is_incognito`, `command_history_entries`)
//!    for Privacy, which drives the full production chain: widget → `Outcome` →
//!    host handler → accessor.
//!
//! ## Why several tests drive the SEARCH box to isolate a row
//!
//! The Motion section renders ~14 sliders. Targeting one by
//! `get_all_by_role(Slider).nth(N)` would silently re-target if a row were added
//! above it — the test would keep passing while asserting about the wrong widget.
//! Instead these tests type the row's canonical label into the REAL search box,
//! which filters to that single row (`row_visible`), making "the only slider on
//! screen" a deterministic, refactor-proof handle. That also exercises the real
//! cross-category search path.
//!
//! ## PTY dependency
//!
//! The three history tests need a live shell: they seed the command history
//! through the REAL echo-gated type-then-Enter capture path (the same path the
//! palette/window-mgmt suites seed with), so `wait_for_echo` blocks on the
//! shell's real echo before pressing Enter. Feeding synthetic rows is
//! deliberately NOT used here, so the Windows-banner screen-reset race that
//! `ensure_focused_spawned` guards does not apply: waiting for the echo of the
//! typed line is itself proof the shell is up and responsive.
