//! Headless **interaction** tests for the C0PL4ND egui shell's LIVE TERMINAL
//! panes (Milestone 2), driven by `egui_kittest` + real PTYs.
//!
//! ## Discipline (non-negotiable)
//!
//! Every test here drives the **real** production frame loop
//! ([`C0pl4ndApp::frame_tick`]) with **simulated input** and asserts the
//! **observable outcome** the input actually caused — there is NO
//! set-state-then-assert-the-same-state tautology. Specifically these tests
//! prove the bug-prone core of Milestone 2:
//!
//! - **type → PTY round-trip**: simulated keystrokes reach the focused pane's
//!   real PTY AND the pane's grid updates with the shell's output. This is the
//!   exact "typing does nothing" failure class the milestone must guard.
//! - **pane focus**: clicking a pane routes input to it (and away from others).
//! - **resize → PTY**: shrinking a pane's rect resizes its PTY grid.
//!
//! The glyphon GPU paint callback cannot run under kittest's headless software
//! path (recon dossier §7) — so the app paints a text fallback when no GPU is
//! present, and these tests assert the PTY/input/resize LOGIC (the bug-prone
//! part). The pixel render is left to the offscreen `screenshot.rs` visual-QA.
//!
//! The app module is compiled in via `#[path]` so the test can construct
//! `C0pl4ndApp` directly; the closure handed to `Harness::new` calls the same
//! `frame_tick` the shipping binary runs each frame.

#![allow(dead_code)] // The `#[path]`-included module has production entry points
                     // (eframe `App` impl, `apply_window_effect`) unused here.
