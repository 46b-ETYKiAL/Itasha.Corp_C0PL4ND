//! On-demand VISUAL-QA snapshots: render the REAL C0pl4ndApp egui frame in
//! several states to PNGs so a human — or an agent with image-reading — can
//! EYEBALL the rendering that cannot be asserted from accessibility/grid state
//! alone.
//!
//! Run on demand (needs a renderer — see [`require_gpu`]; FAILS, never skips,
//! without one):
//!   cargo test -p c0pl4nd --test qa_wide_glyph_snapshot -- --ignored --nocapture
//! Each test prints the absolute PNG path it wrote. The PNGs themselves are not
//! gated — pixel output is non-deterministic across GPU drivers, so nothing here
//! diffs against a committed baseline. The driver-independent assertions below
//! ARE gated, by the `visual-qa` job in ci.yml, which supplies a software
//! rasteriser (lavapipe) so this file has a real CI cell instead of only ever
//! running on a developer's desk.
//!
//! ## What IS asserted (and what is not)
//!
//! Not-gated does not mean not-asserted. [`snapshot`] asserts the two properties
//! that hold on ANY driver: the frame renders at the harness size, and it is not
//! a single uniform colour (i.e. something was actually painted). A blank frame
//! is a real failure mode — a broken paint path still clears the target — and it
//! used to produce a PNG and pass, because this file only rendered and saved.
//!
//! What is NOT asserted, and needs a human (or an agent with image-reading) to
//! eyeball the PNG: glyph shaping, wide/CJK advance widths, colour fidelity,
//! cursor placement, layout. That is the eyeball this file exists for; the
//! assertions only stop it lying when there is nothing to eyeball at all.
