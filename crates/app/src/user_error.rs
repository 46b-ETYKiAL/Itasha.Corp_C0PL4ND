//! User-facing error copy — the single place that turns an internal failure
//! into a short, plain-language sentence with a recovery step.
//!
//! ## Contract (non-negotiable)
//!
//! Nothing technical reaches the user. No error chains, OS errno text, host
//! names, URLs, filesystem paths, or internal identifiers appear in any string
//! this module returns. The raw detail is recorded via `tracing` (diagnostic
//! logs only), so support can still see exactly what happened — it just never
//! lands in the UI. This mirrors the Tauri-IPC error-sanitisation discipline
//! already used by `clear_saved_ui_state`.
//!
//! Every user-visible surface that previously interpolated a raw `{e}` / `{url}`
//! / `{path}` routes through one of the helpers here. The helpers are pure apart
//! from the single `tracing::warn!` side effect, so they are unit-testable and
//! the copy can be asserted to be free of leaked detail.
//!
//! Each binary (the egui shell, the legacy winit shell) and each `#[path]`-
//! included test binary uses a different subset of these helpers, so the module
//! carries a crate-level `dead_code` allowance — exactly like the other shared
//! `#[path]`-included modules (`issue_intake`, `reporting`).
