//! W1TN3SS opt-in crash/error reporting — the C0PL4ND host glue (Tier-1).
//!
//! This module is thin host glue over the in-house `itasha-report-core` SDK
//! (pinned git tag). C0PL4ND implements NO SDK behavior — the config model,
//! sanitizer, spool, transport, preview API and consent gate all live in the
//! SDK and are CALLED here. The two seams this module owns are:
//!
//! 1. **Capture** ([`capture_panic`]) — builds a Tier-1 report from a panic's
//!    `&'static str` message + our own `file:line` SITE, sanitizes it, and
//!    SPOOLS it locally. It transmits NOTHING — local-first, offline-safe,
//!    consent comes later.
//! 2. **Consent-gated send** ([`send_report`]) — given a host-minted
//!    [`ConsentToken`] (which only exists after the user agreed in the consent
//!    dialog, or because the stream's mode is `Always`), transmit one spooled
//!    report through the SDK's hardened transport, then log the outcome.
//!
//! Privacy invariants (inherited from the SDK, asserted at this surface):
//! - default-OFF (both streams default [`ReportingMode::Off`]),
//! - consent-gated (no [`ConsentToken`] => no send — enforced at the type level
//!   by the SDK's `IngestBackend::send` signature),
//! - previewable+editable before send (the dialog calls [`preview_text`]),
//! - no persistent identifier (only the consent token's ephemeral nonce),
//! - the panic `&'static str` discipline (a `String` payload — which could embed
//!   environment fragments or a path — is deliberately suppressed at capture).

    // Coverage-completion tests (W1TN3SS reporting integration). The tests
    // below drive the remaining executable arms of this module — the send
    // backend mapping, the clearnet-with-endpoint and Tor transport paths,
    // the global-config-dir capture/auto-send seams, the telemetry-skip
    // branches, and the spool error arms — all WITHOUT live network or a
    // real Tor bootstrap. The two facts that make this possible deterministically:
    //
    //  1. `Config::config_dir()` is rooted at `%APPDATA%` (Windows) / `$HOME` /
    //     `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (Unix), so a scoped env override points it at a
    //     temp dir — the global capture/auto-send seams become hermetic.
    //  2. The SDK's `TorOnionTransport::send` is FIRE-AND-FORGET: it builds the
    //     padded envelope, enforces the size cap, then SPOOLS the report and
    //     returns `SendOutcome::Sent` synchronously — NO bootstrap, NO circuit,
    //     NO network. So a valid-onion `send_report` returns `Sent` offline,
    //     which lets us cover `send_over_tor` + every `Sent`-removal branch.
