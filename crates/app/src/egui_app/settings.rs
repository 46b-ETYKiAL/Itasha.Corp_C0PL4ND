//! In-app settings window for the C0PL4ND egui chrome (Milestone 2).
//!
//! Replaces the Milestone-1 read-only placeholder with a polished, grouped,
//! well-spaced window that maps the real [`c0pl4nd_core::Config`] fields into
//! logical sections — matching the sibling editor SCR1B3's settings layout for
//! same-company visual cohesion.
//!
//! Layout: a fixed-size window with a **left category nav** + a **searchable,
//! internally-scrolling content pane**, so every setting is reachable at the
//! default window size without ever resizing (the
//! `ScrollArea::auto_shrink([false, false])` idiom is load-bearing here). Each
//! section is a heading + a two-column [`egui::Grid`] of label/control rows, so
//! every control lines up vertically — the system-settings look.
//!
//! Visual cohesion with SCR1B3: identical two-pane structure, GNOME-style
//! spacing rhythm (8 px between related rows, 14 px between sections), brand
//! accents inherited from [`super::theme::itasha_corp_visuals`] (Operator Violet
//! `#7700FF` for press / structure, `.Corp` green `#00FF90` for the live /
//! selected accent), and the per-setting ↺ revert affordance.
//!
//! Kept as a free function so it never fights the `C0pl4ndApp` borrow — the host
//! ([`super::C0pl4ndApp::settings_window`]) calls [`show`] with `&mut config` and
//! reacts to the returned [`Outcome`] (persist + re-apply theme).

// filling slider, the search box) makes the window grow each frame until it hits

// content-width budget: clamp the content `Ui` to these consts (NOT to
// `available_width()`, which is the already-inflated post-balloon width and so
// clamps nothing). No page can then demand more than the budget, so the window
// holds a snug, stable width identical on every page. Sized to fit the 170px
// left nav + a comfortable control pane (label + control + ↺ columns).

/// Snug default window WIDTH (px), before the screen-fit clamp. Wide enough that
