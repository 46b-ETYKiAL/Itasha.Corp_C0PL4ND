//! Per-pane live terminal state for the egui shell (Milestone 2).
//!
//! Each open pane in the [`super::grid`] tree is backed by a [`PaneTerm`]: a
//! live [`c0pl4nd_core::Session`] (PTY + reader thread + shared [`Terminal`]),
//! the active [`Theme`], and the cell metrics that map a pixel rect onto a
//! `(cols, rows)` grid. This module is the testable, bug-prone CORE of
//! Milestone 2:
//!
//! - [`PaneTerm::forward_key`] / [`PaneTerm::write_bytes`] push input to the PTY
//!   via the SHARED [`c0pl4nd_core::term::encode_key`] (the SAME escape-sequence
//!   encoder the winit shell uses — never re-derived here).
//! - [`PaneTerm::resize_to_px`] recomputes `(cols, rows)` from a pixel rect and
//!   resizes the PTY + reflows the grid, but ONLY when the dimensions actually
//!   change (debounced).
//! - [`PaneTerm::grid_rows`] snapshots the visible grid into per-row colour
//!   runs ready for the paint layer, reusing [`Theme::cell_colors`] so the
//!   foreground/background/inverse handling matches the winit renderer exactly.
//!
//! The glyphon GPU paint itself lives in [`super::term_render`]; this module is
//! UI-toolkit-free (no egui, no wgpu) so it can be driven headlessly with
//! simulated input — which is exactly the "typing reaches the PTY and the grid
//! updates" class of bug Milestone 2 must guard against.
