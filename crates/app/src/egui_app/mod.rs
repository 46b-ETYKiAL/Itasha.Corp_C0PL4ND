//! Milestone 1 of the C0PL4ND egui chrome modernization (recon dossier
//! `.s4f3-data/recon-c0pl4nd-egui-modernization.md`, steps 1–4).
//!
//! This module is the modern `eframe`/`egui` application shell, shipped as a
//! SEPARATE binary (`c0pl4nd-egui`) so the existing winit-driven `c0pl4nd`
//! binary keeps building and shipping unchanged. The chrome (frameless
//! titlebar, two-tone wordmark, tab strip, caption buttons, status bar) and the
//! `egui_tiles` pane grid are real and clickable; each pane body hosts a live
//! PTY whose visible grid is drawn with egui's NATIVE coloured-text painter (see
//! [`paint_grid_native`]). An earlier milestone rendered the grid through a
//! glyphon GPU paint callback / offscreen texture, but that path composited
//! black inside `egui_tiles` panes on the real swapchain (while passing the wgpu
//! test harness); native text renders reliably everywhere and matches SCR1B3's
//! coloured-text approach, so the glyphon path was removed.
//!
//! eframe owns the event loop; no winit plumbing here.
