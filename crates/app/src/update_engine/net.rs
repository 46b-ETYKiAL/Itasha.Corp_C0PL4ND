//! Network half of the in-app self-updater.
//!
//! Telemetry-free by construction: the only network surfaces are
//! 1. a single unauthenticated `GET` of the public GitHub Releases API,
//! 2. download of the SIGNED `latest.json` manifest + its `.minisig`, and
//! 3. downloads of the release archive + its `.minisig` + `.sha256` siblings.
//!
//! No analytics, no identifiers, no payload: every request sends only a generic
//! `User-Agent` (app name + version). A Tier-1 client installs ONLY through the
//! verified signed manifest — the archive is verified (its bytes pinned to the
//! manifest's SIGNED SHA-256, then minisign against
//! [`super::verify::EMBEDDED_PUBLIC_KEY`]) before the extracted binary is ever
//! returned. A verify failure deletes the staging area and the binary is NEVER
//! returned unverified. There is no install path that skips the manifest.
//!
//! Pure decision logic ([`resolve_tier1_update`]) is split out from the I/O so
//! it can be unit-tested offline against a fixture [`RawRelease`] + manifest.
//!
//! ## Asset naming
//!
//! C0PL4ND's release workflow publishes, per target, an archive whose name
//! embeds both the tag and the Rust target triple — `c0pl4nd-<tag>-<target>.zip`
//! on Windows, `c0pl4nd-<tag>-<target>.tar.gz` on Unix — plus a `.sha256` and a
//! `.minisig` sidecar. [`manifest::Manifest::archive_for`] matches by the
//! **target-triple substring + archive extension** rather than an exact
//! filename, so it is robust to the tag prefix.

    // =====================================================================
    // E2E_API — hermetic transport harness for the confined GET
    // =====================================================================
    //
    // ## What this harness IS
    //
    // The tests above prove the confinement PREDICATES (`assert_https`,
    // `host_allowed`) in isolation, and the `download_verify_extract_refuses_*`
    // tests prove the FIRST url is checked. None of them enters
    // `confined_get_with`'s redirect walk, so the security property the doc
    // comment on `confined_get` actually claims — that https AND the host
    // allow-list are RE-ASSERTED AT EVERY HOP — was, before this harness,
    // asserted by no test at all. A predicate being correct does not prove it is
    // CALLED on hop 2.
    //
    // The harness closes that gap by injecting at the `ureq::Agent` boundary via
    // ureq's `Middleware`. A middleware that never calls `next.handle(req)`
    // short-circuits the chain ABOVE `unit::connect`, so no socket, no DNS
    // resolution and no TLS handshake ever occur (see `MockTransport::handle`).
    // Responses are synthesized with `impl FromStr for Response`, which parses a
    // full status line + headers, letting us drive `Location` / `Content-Length`.
    //
    // Crucially the mock replaces ONLY the third-party transport. Everything
    // under test — the `assert_https` / `assert_allowed_host` calls, the
    // redirect walk, `resolve_redirect`, the `MAX_REDIRECTS` cap, the
    // declared-size check — is the REAL production code path. Injecting any
    // higher (at `confined_get`/`fetch_latest_release` level) would degenerate
    // into a tautology that merely re-tested serde against a fixture, which the
    // `RawRelease` tests already cover.
    //
    // ## What this harness DOES NOT PROVE  (read before trusting a green run)
    //
    // Because the socket is never opened, these are OUT OF SCOPE here and are
    // NOT covered by any assertion below:
    //   * TLS itself: handshake, protocol version, cipher selection.
    //   * Certificate validation, hostname verification, pinning, revocation.
    //   * DNS resolution and any DNS-rebinding class of attack (a host that
    //     passes the allow-list string check but RESOLVES to an attacker IP is
    //     NOT addressed by this defense at all — the allow-list is a string
    //     gate, and this harness only proves the string gate runs per hop).
    //   * That `default_agent`'s connect/read timeouts actually fire (no real
    //     socket can stall), nor any slow-loris behaviour.
    //   * Real GitHub API compatibility: that api.github.com truly returns the
    //     shapes synthesized here, or that its real redirect chain stays inside
    //     the allow-list.
    //   * The `Err(ureq::Error::Status(code, r))` 3xx arm of the walk: ureq maps
    //     only >=400 to `Error::Status`, so a synthesized 3xx always arrives via
    //     the `Ok(r)` arm. That arm is defensive and stays untested here.
    //   * Proxy handling and connection pooling.
